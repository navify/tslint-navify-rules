# TSLint rules for Navify

Common TypeScript lint rules/preferences for Navify.

## Usage

```bash
npm i -D tslint-navify-rules
```

There is a strict flavor of lint rules, which we recommend:

```json
{
  "extends": "tslint-navify-rules/strict"
}
```

Otherwise, extend the base rules:

```json
{
  "extends": "tslint-navify-rules"
}
```
